# Coursera Computing for Data Analysis

* best3.R - Takes as input a state (2 letter code) and outcome (heart attack, pnuemonia, or heart failure), and returns the best hospital.
* rankhospital2.R - Takes as input a state, outcome, and numerical rank, and returns the hospital with that rank.
* corr.R - Reads all csv files in a directory, counts how many data rows are non-empty, and if this count is greater than a threshold it dumps the good values into an output numeric vector.  If the count is less than or equal to the threshold, it returns a vector of 0 length.
* complete.R - Takes as input a numeric code and directory name, and then locates a csv file (with id, in directory) and counts the number of good (non-NA) entries.
* rankall.R - Ranks all hospitals by outcome.
